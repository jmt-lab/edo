# Edo

A next-generation build tool with flexible environment control and reproducible builds.

## Overview

Edo is a modern build tool implemented in Rust that addresses critical limitations in existing build systems like Bazel, Buck2, and BuildStream. The primary innovation of Edo is its flexible approach to build environments while maintaining reproducibility.

### Key Differentiators

- **Environment Control**: Precise control over build environments without being tied to specific technologies
- **Extensibility**: WebAssembly-based plugin system that allows customization of any component
- **Artifact-Centric Design**: OCI-compatible artifact model for consistent handling across storage backends
- **Build Reproducibility**: Deterministic builds with comprehensive input tracking
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows with consistent behavior

## Features

- **Flexible Build Environments**: Choose between local system, Docker containers, or custom environments
- **Powerful Caching**: Multi-level caching with content-addressed storage
- **Dependency Resolution**: Sophisticated dependency management with version constraint satisfaction
- **Parallel Execution**: Optimized parallel build execution based on dependency graph
- **WebAssembly Plugins**: Extend any component with plugins written in any language that compiles to WebAssembly
- **Declarative TOML Configuration**: Simple, deterministic project manifests (`edo.toml`) with a `schema-version` envelope for forward compatibility

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.86 or newer

## Quick Start

## Architecture

Edo is built on four core components that work together to provide a flexible, reproducible build experience:

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│   Storage   │◄────┤    Source   │◄────┤ Environment │◄────┤  Transform  │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
        │                  │                  │                   │
        └──────────────────┴──────────────────┴───────────────────┘
                                    │
                            ┌───────▼───────┐
                            │ Plugin System │
                            └───────────────┘
```

### Storage Component

Manages the caching and persistence of all artifacts in the build system. Provides a unified interface for storing, retrieving, and managing artifacts regardless of their underlying storage mechanism.

### Source Component

Handles the acquisition of external code and artifacts for the build system. Ensures reproducible builds by providing a consistent, verifiable way to fetch dependencies from various origins.

### Environment Component

Provides flexible, pluggable control over where and how builds execute. Enables precise environment configuration while maintaining reproducibility across different execution contexts.

### Transform Component

Processes input artifacts into output artifacts according to defined build operations. Manages build dependencies and execution order through a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

### Plugin System

Extends any component using WebAssembly-based plugins. Allows customization of the build system without modifying the core codebase.

## Use Cases

Edo is particularly well-suited for:

- **OS Builders**: Projects like Bottlerocket that need fine-grained control over build environments
- **Application Packaging**: Creating portable applications for platforms like Flatpak and Snap
- **Cross-Platform Development**: Ensuring consistent builds across different operating systems
- **Monorepos**: Managing complex dependencies in large codebases
- **Binary Compatibility**: Creating binaries with specific GLIBC version compatibility

## Configuration Reference

Edo uses TOML for build configuration. A project is described by an `edo.toml` file at its root, dispatched by a top-level `schema-version` field (currently `"1"`).

A minimal example (see `examples/hello_rust/edo.toml` for a full walkthrough):

```toml
schema-version = "1"

[source.src]
kind       = "local"
path       = "hello_rust"
out        = "."
is_archive = false

[transform.code]
kind   = "import"
source = ["//hello_rust/src"]

[transform.build]
kind     = "script"
depends  = ["//hello_rust/code"]
commands = [
    "mkdir -p {{install-root}}/bin",
    "cargo build --release",
    "cp target/release/hello_rust {{install-root}}/bin/hello_rust",
]
```

Top-level sections: `[config]`, `[cache.source.*]` / `[cache.build]` / `[cache.output]`, `[plugin.*]`, `[environment.*]`, `[source.*]`, `[transform.*]`, `[vendor.*]`, `[requires.*]`. Script transform commands are rendered with Handlebars and receive variables such as `{{install-root}}` and `{{build-root}}`.

Builtin kinds shipped by the core plugin:

| Component       | Kinds                                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Storage backend | `s3`                                        |
| Environment     | `local`, `container`                        |
| Source          | `git`, `local`, `image`, `remote`, `vendor` |
| Transform       | `compose`, `import`, `script`               |
| Vendor          | `image`                                     |

Additional kinds can be supplied by loading a WebAssembly plugin via `[plugin.<name>]`.
