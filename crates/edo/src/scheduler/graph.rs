//! DAG-based execution graph for parallel transform orchestration.
//!
//! [`Graph`] is the data structure the scheduler uses to plan and execute a
//! build. It owns:
//!
//! - the directed acyclic graph itself (a `daggy::Dag<Arc<Node>, String>`),
//! - a bidirectional [`Addr`] ↔ [`NodeIndex`] index for O(1) lookups,
//! - per-root *subgraph* sets (the slice of nodes reachable from each
//!   user-requested target via the `depends` relation), and
//! - per-root *indegree templates* — precomputed maps that the dispatcher
//!   clones and mutates while running so it never has to walk the parent set
//!   of a node at dispatch time.
//!
//! ## Lifecycle
//!
//! A typical use of [`Graph`] looks like:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let mut g = Graph::new(workers);
//! g.add(ctx, &target).await?;        // build the DAG
//! g.fetch(ctx).await?;               // hash + cache-check + prepare
//! Arc::new(g).run(path, ctx, &target).await?; // execute
//! ```
//!
//! Each phase is independent and can fail without leaving the graph in a
//! corrupt state — a partially-built graph is still safe to drop.
//!
//! ## Why per-root subgraphs?
//!
//! The graph can hold transforms that are *not* reachable from the current
//! target (e.g. when a previous `add` call brought in an unrelated subtree).
//! Dispatch must operate on the active slice only, otherwise the indegree
//! count would include edges from outside the slice and a node could remain
//! "blocked" forever. The per-root subgraph membership set lets `run` filter
//! both the BFS frontier and child enqueue walks cheaply.
