//! Transform subsystem.
//!
//! A [`Transform`] converts source artifacts into build artifacts by executing
//! steps inside an [`Environment`](crate::environment::Environment). The
//! scheduler invokes transforms in dependency order, feeding each one a
//! prepared environment and collecting the resulting [`Artifact`](crate::storage::Artifact)
//! via [`TransformStatus`].
//!
//! All fallible operations return [`TransformResult`], with failures modelled
//! by [`TransformError`].
