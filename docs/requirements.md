# Edo Build Tool Requirements Specification

## Executive Summary

Edo is a next-generation build tool implemented in Rust that addresses key limitations in existing build tools like Bazel, Buck2, and BuildStream. It provides significantly more control and flexibility around build environments while maintaining reproducibility, particularly focused on enabling software developers to build applications for platforms like Flatpak and Snap, as well as OS builders like Bottlerocket.

## 1. Problem Statement

Modern software development, particularly in monorepo environments, faces significant challenges in controlling build environments while maintaining reproducibility and portability. While contemporary build tools like Buck2, Bazel, and Pants excel at managing complex dependency graphs and providing efficient builds for monorepo architectures, they lack robust capabilities for fine-grained control over the build environment itself.

Existing solutions either provide insufficient environment control or impose restrictive implementation requirements. For instance, Apache BuildStream offers environment specification capabilities but tightly couples this functionality with specific technologies like chroots and bubblewrap namespaces, limiting its flexibility and broader adoption.

A recurring challenge in software development is the need to produce portable binaries with specific compatibility requirements, particularly regarding GLIBC versions. Current build tools do not provide a straightforward, reliable mechanism to control compiler versions and build environments to achieve these compatibility targets. This limitation often results in binaries that are unnecessarily restricted to newer GLIBC versions, reducing their portability across different Linux distributions and versions.

## 2. Goals

### 2.1 Flexible Architecture

- Create a build tool that builds upon the proven concepts of established solutions like Buck2, Bazel, Pants, and BuildStream
- Implement a modular design that allows components to be replaced or customized without affecting the core build logic
- Maintain separation between build environment specification and build execution

### 2.2 Extensible Plugin System

- Provide a robust plugin API that enables runtime loading of custom build logic
- Allow users to implement and integrate their own build strategies without modifying the core system
- Support plugin versioning and compatibility checking to ensure system stability

### 2.3 Reliable Build Reproducibility

- Implement a secure hashing mechanism that uniquely identifies build artifacts based on their inputs
- Ensure deterministic builds by tracking all inputs that could affect build outputs
- Optimize build performance by skipping unnecessary rebuilds when inputs haven't changed
- Maintain a clear audit trail of build inputs and their corresponding outputs

## 3. Architectural Requirements

  - Local system execution

- Must support dependency tracking and incremental builds
- Must allow for custom transform implementations
- Must participate in a DAG-based dependency resolution system for build optimization

### 3.2 Extensibility Requirements

- Must implement a plugin system that allows extending any of the core components:
  - Storage Backends
  - Source providers
  - Environment implementations
  - Transform definitions
- Must support runtime loading of plugins to ensure system flexibility
- Must discover plugins through `[plugin.<name>]` tables declared in `edo.toml`
- Must fetch plugin binaries according to the source instructions in each `[plugin.<name>]` table

### 3.3 Build Configuration Requirements

- Must define build configuration declaratively in TOML, using a top-level `schema-version = "1"` envelope
- Must organise configuration into keyed sections: `[config]`, `[cache.source.*]`, `[cache.build]`, `[cache.output]`, `[plugin.<name>]`, `[environment.<name>]`, `[source.<name>]`, `[transform.<name>]`, `[vendor.<name>]`, and `[requires.<name>]`
- Must ensure deterministic evaluation of build configurations
- Must support custom behaviour through plugin-provided kinds rather than an in-file scripting language
- Must maintain clear separation between build definition (TOML) and execution (Context + Scheduler)
- Must use the `edo.toml` filename for all project build configuration files

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Build Environment Management

- Must support building in Docker containers
- Must support building in the local environment
- Must allow extension through plugins for custom environments
- Must provide network isolation for container-based builds
- Should allow optional network access for local builds

### 4.2 Artifact Management

- Must support artifact acquisition from external sources via source instructions
- Must support both local and remote caches for artifacts
- Must implement content-addressable storage for artifacts
- Must store artifacts as OCI-compatible artifacts with custom manifests
- Must support artifact invalidation through user-initiated commands (`edo prune`)

### 4.3 Dependency Resolution

- Must support two-fold dependency approaches:
  - Internal dependencies between transform actions (via DAG)
  - External dependencies declared in `[requires.<name>]` tables and resolved through `[vendor.<name>]` providers
- Must implement dependency resolution for external artifacts via the `[requires.*]` tables
- Must generate and utilize resolution lock files (edo.lock.json) for reproducible builds
- Must provide commands to update resolution lock files as needed

### 4.4 Build Execution

- Must efficiently execute builds based on an optimized DAG
- Must skip unnecessary rebuilds when inputs haven't changed

- Must enforce interface compliance through a well-defined plugin contract

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Performance

- Must optimize build performance to minimize overhead beyond actual build operations

- Must efficiently handle large monorepos and extensive dependency graphs
- Must support future capability to offload individual builds to remote executors for scaling

### 5.2 Security

- Must enforce sandboxing for non-local build environments
- Must provide network isolation for container-based builds
- Should implement appropriate security models for the plugin system

- No backward compatibility requirements with existing build tools

## 6. User Experience Requirements

### 6.1 Command Line Interface

- Must provide an intuitive CLI for all operations
- Must support common operations:
  - Building specific targets (`edo run <addr>`)
  - Extracting a built artifact to a local directory (`edo checkout <addr> <out>`)
  - Listing defined transforms / targets (`edo list`)
  - Updating dependency lock files (`edo update`)
  - Pruning cached artifacts (`edo prune`)

Plugin lifecycle is declarative rather than imperative: plugins are declared in `[plugin.<name>]` tables in `edo.toml` and fetched automatically during project load, so no dedicated plugin-management subcommand is required.

### 6.2 Configuration Experience

- Must use TOML for build files and configurations, with the `schema-version` field selecting the schema dispatch

- Should consider distributed caching mechanisms for large teams

### 7.3 IDE Integration

- Should consider providing integration points for common IDEs
- Should explore build visualization capabilities

## 8. Implementation Constraints
